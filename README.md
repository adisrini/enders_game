# game
First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2016

Name: Aditya Srinivasan

Date started: 14 January 2016

Date finished: 24 January 2016

Hours worked: 40 hours

Resources used: StackOverflow, YouTube, AlmasB, CodeSmells

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: Images (images folder containing main-bg.jpg, platformer-bg.jpg, ...)

How to play the game: In Destroyer mode, use the arrow keys to move and jump and the spacebar to shoot. The Shift button flips gravity and allows you to walk on ceilings, which you must do to get past certain parts of the level. In Strategist mode, you must place mirrors in tiles in order to deflect your bullet towards the enemy.

Keys/Mouse input: Destroyer mode: ARROW KEYS -> movement, SPACEBAR -> shoot, SHIFT -> flip gravity.
Strategist mode: LEFT MOUSECLICK -> toggle mirror, SPACEBAR -> fire bullet

Cheat Keys: In Destroyer mode, you can enable God Mode by pressing 'G', making yourself invulnerable to falling or enemies. You can enable Invisibility Mode by pressing 'I' to make yourself invisible and walk through walls.

Known bugs: In Destroyer mode, if you jump too many times when there is a platform above you, the player can get stuck and only return to the floor after waiting for a while. Further, sometimes a bullet may pass straight through the easy enemies in Destroyer mode, and other times it hits them.

Extra features: Can somewhat easily alter Settings files and LevelData files to change the levels yourself and customize gameplay. You can pause the game in Destroyer mode. There are also alien enemies with heat-seeking bullets in Destroyer mode including a boss room. There is a leap of faith at the end of the Platformer that you must complete in order to load the next part of the level (you will see it when you get to it).

Impressions/Suggestions: This was an extremely tough assignment given I have had no experience with JavaFX or good game design practices. The brief was fairly broad which was nice as it allowed students to work on a project they were interested in. I felt that even though it was challenging, it was extremely fun and I found myself gladly working on it.
